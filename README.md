# QueueList

ONLY UPDATE THE APP FOLDER, DONT UPLOAD ANY OTHER FOLDERS, this will mess up the push/pull calls

CMSC436
An application that organizes the office hours by implementing a queue in which students can use, and TAs can access. 

Refer to this for the layout: https://www.fluidui.com/editor/live/comment/cF9OaXFhVFVVcWRrenpEZlBtSnRlenRpcGR1R2Zzd3g2cQ==

Agenda:
    Create SMS (Text message) notification if the student will be helped.
    Create a table for spinner in database so we can dynamically add projects to the spinner for student applicaiton
        Also means we need to have an option for instructors to add a project to the table
    Make the App distinguish which class is being used ("It only works for 131")
    Check if student ID already exists in the table, dont add that student if they exist
