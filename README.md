ONLY UPDATE THE APP FOLDER, DONT UPLOAD ANY OTHER FOLDERS, this will mess up the push/pull calls

CMSC436
An application that organizes the office hours by implementing a queue in which students can use, and TAs can access. 

Refer to this for the layout: https://www.fluidui.com/editor/live/comment/cF9OaXFhVFVVcWRrenpEZlBtSnRlenRpcGR1R2Zzd3g2cQ==

Agenda: <br /><br />
    <strike>Create SMS (Text message) notification if the student will be helped.</strike> <br />
    <strike>Create a table for spinner in database so we can dynamically add projects to the spinner for student application </strike><br />
        <strike>Also means we need to have an option for instructors to add a project to the table</strike> <br />
    Make the App distinguish which class is being used ("It only works for 131") <br />
    Check if student ID already exists in the table, dont add that student if they exist <br />
